                <h2 class="featurette-heading">3 things I do that you could also do. <span class="text-muted">It’ll blow your mind.</span></h2>
                <p class="lead">As I mentioned above, organization and creativity help me make the best food choices every day. This is because, the way I see it, healthy eating is a choice we make every time we eat.

                    For this reason, I try to make the decision-making process as easy as possible when I’m choosing a meal or snack. That way, I can continue to choose what is best for me.

                    Here are three things I do on a daily or weekly basis that make it easier for me to eat healthily.

                <h3>Meal prep</h3>

                    While this may sound cliché, preparing my food beforehand for the week really does the trick.

                    Cooking can take up a lot of time, but having food that just needs to be heated and served allows me to have a nutritious meal ready in minutes.

                    One of my go-to meal-prepping tips is to cook a batch of proteins — usually chicken or another lean meat — that I can portion and freeze for over a week and just defrost as I need them.

                    I also make sure to prep vegetables for the week. This way, I don’t think twice before having some salad or cooking a side of veggies with each meal.

                    I try to prepare them in different ways to avoid getting bored and choosing not to eat them.

                    For example, when it comes to carrots or zucchinis, I’ll either slice, dice, grate, or spiralize them, all of which help me incorporate them into my meals easily.

                <h3>Keep fruit within arm’s reach</h3>

                    Keeping my fruit visible reminds me to eat fruit during the day.

                    Research shows that you’re most likely to eat more of whatever foods you place near you, regardless of whether they are fruits or sweets (2, 3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).

                    I implement this principle daily and choose to have my fruit on display on a table and my snacks and sweets stored away.

                <h3>Follow a routine</h3>

                    While I don’t officially plan a weekly menu, I do have a specific set of dishes that I stick to at every meal.

                    For example, my breakfast choices usually include:

                    a Costa Rican classic of gallo pinto and eggs
                    toast with peanut butter and a side of eggs
                    oatmeal with fruit
                    oatmeal pancakes
                    The same goes for the rest of my meals and snacks, where I have at least three different options to choose from without giving it much thought.

                    Having a predetermined set of dishes that I know I like saves me time having to decide what to eat, and it allows me to vary my meals depending on whether I crave something sweet or savory.

                    It’s also very convenient for grocery shopping, as you already know what you’ll most likely be having at every meal.</p>
